# Overview of the Analysis:
The purpose of the analysis was to practice my SQL queries to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This analysis will help the company Pewlett Hackard prepare for the large amount of employees on the verge of retirement and to establish a mentorship program while the employees are still there.


## Part 1 The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
Some of the concepts demonstrated in this section were creating new tables with the INTO statement, exporting a table as a CSV file, filtering queries with the WHERE clause, using the INNER JOIN clause to join two tables on a primary key, and using the GROUPBY() DISTINCT ON () ORDER BY () COUNT() functions. The first csv that is exported is a list of the current employees that will likely be retiring soon alongside their titles.

### Retirement Titles
The table shows the employees that are in the age range for retirement and the titles that they have had attached to the employee number key.
